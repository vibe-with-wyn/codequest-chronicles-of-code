  questions:
  - questionText: Which of the following correctly declares a String variable in
      Java?
    choices:
    - choiceText: string message = "Hello World";
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: char message = "Hello World";
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: String message = "Hello World";
      isCorrect: 1
    - choiceText: text message = "Hello World";
      isCorrect: 0
    hintOnWrongAnswer: Remember that in Java, the String class starts with a capital
      'S', and text must be enclosed in double quotes.
    explanationOnCorrect: That's right! Strings are declared using the String class
      (capital S) followed by the variable name and the text in double quotes.
  - questionText: 'What is the output of: System.out.println("Code" + "Quest");'
    choices:
    - choiceText: CodeQuest
      isCorrect: 1
    - choiceText: Code Quest
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: Code+Quest
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: Error
      isCorrect: 0
    hintOnWrongAnswer: The + operator joins strings directly without adding spaces.
      Think about what happens when you add two pieces of text together.
    explanationOnCorrect: Correct! The + operator concatenates (joins) two strings
      together without any space between them.
  - questionText: What does \n represent in a string?
    choices:
    - choiceText: The letter 'n'
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: A tab space
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: A backslash
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: A newline (line break)
      isCorrect: 1
    hintOnWrongAnswer: Escape sequences start with a backslash (\) and represent
      special characters. The letter 'n' in \n stands for 'newline'.
    explanationOnCorrect: Excellent! \n is an escape sequence that creates a new
      line, moving the cursor to the next line.
  - questionText: What is the difference between System.out.print() and System.out.println()?
    choices:
    - choiceText: println() adds a newline after printing, print() does not
      isCorrect: 1
    - choiceText: print() adds a newline after printing, println() does not
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: They are exactly the same
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: println() prints numbers, print() prints text
      isCorrect: 0
    hintOnWrongAnswer: Think about what 'ln' might stand for in println(). It's short
      for 'line'!
    explanationOnCorrect: Perfect! println() automatically adds a line break after
      printing, while print() keeps the cursor on the same line.
  - questionText: Which method returns the number of characters in a string?
    choices:
    - choiceText: .size()
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: '.length() '
      isCorrect: 1
    - choiceText: .count()
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: .characters()
      isCorrect: 0
    hintOnWrongAnswer: In Java, Strings use .length() to count characters. This is
      different from arrays which use .length (without parentheses).
    explanationOnCorrect: That's right! The .length() method returns the total number
      of characters in a string, including spaces.
  - questionText: What does \t represent in Java?
    choices:
    - choiceText: The letter 't'
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: A newline
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: A tab space
      isCorrect: 1
    - choiceText: Time
      isCorrect: 0
    hintOnWrongAnswer: The 't' in \t stands for 'tab'. It creates horizontal spacing
      in your output.
    explanationOnCorrect: Correct! \t inserts a tab space (usually 4-8 spaces) in
      your output, useful for formatting text.
  - questionText: 'What is the output of: System.out.println("Score: " + 100 + 50);'
    choices:
    - choiceText: 'Score: 100 + 50'
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: 'Score: 150'
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: 'Score: 10050'
      isCorrect: 1
    - choiceText: Error
      isCorrect: 0
    hintOnWrongAnswer: The + operator works left to right. Once it encounters a string,
      everything after becomes string concatenation, not arithmetic!
    explanationOnCorrect: 'Excellent! When a string is concatenated with numbers
      using +, Java converts the numbers to text and joins them left to right: "Score:
      " + "100" + "50" = "Score: 10050".'
