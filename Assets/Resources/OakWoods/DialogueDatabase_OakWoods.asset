    - speaker: Arin
      text: You fought bravely. Not many step into that cave and walk back out.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: You looked like you needed help.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "I did. Thank you. You don\u2019t look like a local. What brings you
        to Oak Woods?"
    - speaker: Roran
      text: "I\u2019m new to this land. I\u2019m searching for knowledge\u2014and
        a way to survive."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Then you\u2019ve chosen the right power. Here, code is more than ink\u2014it
        moves the world."
    - speaker: Roran
      text: "I\u2019ve heard. But I don\u2019t know where to start."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Start with me. I\u2019ll mentor you. Come to my cottage. We\u2019ll
        begin with Java: what it is, and how to speak it."
    - speaker: Roran
      text: Lead the way.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Follow me to the edge of the woods. Don\u2019t stray. The forest tests
        syntax more than strength."
  - conversationId: Arin_02_JavaBasics
    lines:
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Let\u2019s start simple. Java is a language used to build many kinds
        of applications."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: You put code inside a class. A class is a container for your program.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Programs begin in a special method named main. Java looks for this to
        start.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "The exact main method you\u2019ll use is:"
    - speaker: Arin
      text: public static void main(String[] args)
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Curly braces { } group code. End each statement with a semicolon ;
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'To show text: System.out.println("your message");'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: The class name should start with a capital letter, like HelloOak.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Now fill in the blanks to create your first program: class, main, and
        a println.'
    - speaker: Roran
      text: Understood. Class, main, braces, semicolons, and System.out.println.
  - conversationId: Arin_02b_PostHello
    lines:
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Well done! Your first program prints a message.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: So many symbols for one sentence.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Symbols give structure; structure gives power. Next, we\u2019ll store
        values using variables and types."
  - conversationId: Arin_03_TypesLecture
    lines:
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Variables store information. Each has a type and a name.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Common types: int (whole numbers), double (decimals), boolean (true/false),
        String (text).'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Examples:'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: int lives = 3;    double speed = 2.5;
    - speaker: Arin
      text: boolean isMage = false;    String name = "Roran";
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Remember: end with a semicolon. Names are case-sensitive.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Gather the runes int, boolean, and String, then fix the Declarations
        Tablet.
  - conversationId: Arin_03_PostTypes
    lines:
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Your types align. The grove\u2019s wards are stable again."
    - speaker: Roran
      text: A missing semicolon breaks everything.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "That\u2019s syntax. Next: strings and printing details."
  - conversationId: Arin_04_StringsLecture
    lines:
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Strings are text in quotes, like "Hello".
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Use System.out.println to print with a new line, or System.out.print
        to stay on the same line.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Join pieces with +, like "Name: " + name.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Escape sequences help inside quotes: \" for a quote, \\ for backslash,
        \n for new line, \t for tab.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Fix the print lines to show your name and a two-line message using these
        rules.
  - conversationId: Arin_04_PostStrings
    lines:
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Clear and correct. Your text rings true.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: I can shape messages exactly now.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'One final trial: build a clean class with main and valid statements.'
  - conversationId: Arin_05_SyntaxRecap
    lines:
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Recap: A class wraps code. main is the entry point.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Statements end with semicolons. Braces must match.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'You can add comments: // single line, or /* multi-line */.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Use declarations and println with concatenation to present information
        clearly.
  - conversationId: Arin_05_Epilogue
    lines:
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "You\u2019ve mastered the basics of Java syntax. Oak Woods recognizes
        you."
    - speaker: Roran
      text: "I can finally read the forest\u2019s words."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Syntax is your compass. Keep practicing, Codebreaker.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: Thank you, Arin.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "If fate loops us back, I\u2019ll be here. For now, walk on."
