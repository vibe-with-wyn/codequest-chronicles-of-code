    - speaker: Arin
      text: You fought bravely. Not many step into this cave and walk back out.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: You looked like you needed help.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: I did. Thank you. You don't look like a local. What brings you to Oak
        Woods?
    - speaker: Roran
      text: "I'm new to this land. I'm searching for knowledge\u2014and a way to
        survive."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Knowledge, you say? Then fate has brought you to the right place.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Here in Oak Woods, we don't wield swords or cast spells like other lands.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "We command something far more powerful\u2014the language of creation
        itself."
    - speaker: Roran
      text: The language of creation?
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Code. Here, code is more than ink on parchment\u2014it shapes reality,
        commands the elements, bends the very fabric of this world."
    - speaker: Roran
      text: I've heard whispers of such power, but I never believed it was real.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Oh, it's real. The Night Borne you just helped me defeat? Born from corrupted
        code fragments.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: The wards protecting our villages? Written in precise syntax. Even the
        trees respond to properly structured commands.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: That's... incredible. But I don't know where to begin. I've never written
        a line of code in my life.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Everyone starts somewhere. I was once like you\u2014lost, uncertain,
        overwhelmed by symbols I didn't understand."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: But a mentor took me in, just as I will take you in now.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: You would teach me?
    - speaker: Arin
      text: You saved my life in that battle. The least I can do is help you save
        your own future.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Besides, Oak Woods needs more Codebreakers\u2014those who can read and
        write the ancient syntax."
    - speaker: Roran
      text: Codebreakers... I like the sound of that.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Then come. My cabin isn't far from here. We'll start with the foundations.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "First, I'll teach you Java\u2014one of the oldest and most respected
        tongues in the realm of code."
    - speaker: Roran
      text: Java. I'm ready to learn.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Good. But heed my warning: the path of a programmer is not easy.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Every symbol matters. One misplaced semicolon, one unclosed brace, and
        your creation crumbles.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: The forest itself will test you. It recognizes syntax, rewards precision,
        and punishes carelessness.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: I understand. I won't let you down.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "I believe you won't. Now follow me closely\u2014and stay on the path."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Oak Woods tests syntax more than strength. Wander off, and the trees
        might just compile you into something... unpleasant.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: Noted. Staying on the path.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Smart choice. Come, the cabin awaits. Your journey as a Codebreaker begins
        today.

    - speaker: Arin
      text: Welcome to my cabin. Let's begin your journey into the world of Java
        programming.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: I'm ready to learn.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Java is a powerful programming language used to build applications\u2014from
        mobile apps to large enterprise systems."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "It's one of the most popular languages in the world. Banks, games, websites\u2014many
        rely on Java."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Every Java program starts with a CLASS. Think of a class as a container
        that holds your code.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'The class name should start with a capital letter. For example: HelloWorld,
        MyProgram, or Calculator.'
    - speaker: Roran
      text: So every program needs a class?
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Exactly! Without a class, Java won't even recognize your code. It's the
        foundation.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Inside a class, you need a special method called MAIN. This is where
        your program begins execution.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'The exact signature you must memorize is:'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: public static void main(String[] args)
    - speaker: Roran
      text: That's a lot of words. What do they mean?
    - speaker: Arin
      text: PUBLIC means it can be accessed from anywhere. STATIC means it belongs
        to the class itself, not an instance.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: VOID means it doesn't return any value. And String[] args allows you
        to pass text arguments when running the program.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: For now, just remember the pattern. Understanding will come with practice.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: So I just need to write it exactly like that every time?
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Yes! Every standalone Java program needs this exact main method. Think
        of it as the starting gate.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Next: CURLY BRACES. They group blocks of code together. Every opening
        brace { needs a closing brace }.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Your class starts with { and ends with }. Your main method also starts
        with { and ends with }.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Think of braces like parentheses in math\u2014they show what belongs
        together."
    - speaker: Roran
      text: So braces organize the code into sections?
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Precisely! They define scope\u2014what code belongs to the class, what
        belongs to the method."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Inside the main method, you write STATEMENTS\u2014instructions for the
        computer to execute."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Every statement must end with a SEMICOLON ;  Think of it as a period
        ending a sentence.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Without the semicolon, Java won't know where one instruction ends and
        another begins.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: 'So: class, main method, braces, and semicolons. Got it.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Good! Now, to display text output, use: System.out.println("your message");'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "println stands for 'print line'\u2014it prints text and moves to a new
        line."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'The text goes inside DOUBLE QUOTES, like this: "Hello, Oak Woods!"'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Let me show you some examples:'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'System.out.println("Welcome, traveler!");  prints: Welcome, traveler!'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'System.out.println("Java is powerful!");  prints: Java is powerful!'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'System.out.println("Learning to code!");  prints: Learning to code!'
    - speaker: Roran
      text: So I can print any message I want?
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Exactly! Just put it in quotes, inside the parentheses, and end with
        a semicolon.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Remember: System.out.println with parentheses, quotes around text, and
        a semicolon at the end.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Here are more examples to help you understand:'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: System.out.println("My name is Roran");
    - speaker: Arin
      text: System.out.println("I am learning Java");
    - speaker: Arin
      text: System.out.println("This is my first program");
    - speaker: Roran
      text: System.out.println, quotes, semicolon. I understand.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Perfect. Now let me show you what a complete program looks like:'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println("Hello!");
        } }
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Let''s break that down piece by piece:'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "First: class HelloWorld {  \u2014 This starts our class and opens its
        code block."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Second: public static void main(String[] args) {  \u2014 This starts
        our main method."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Third: System.out.println(\"Hello!\");  \u2014 This prints our message."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Fourth: }  \u2014 This closes the main method."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Fifth: }  \u2014 This closes the class."
    - speaker: Roran
      text: So every brace that opens must close?
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Yes! If you forget to close a brace, your program won't compile. It's
        a common mistake.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Here''s another complete example:'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: class Welcome { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println("Welcome
        to Oak Woods!"); } }
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'And one more to make sure you understand:'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: class MyFirstProgram { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println("I
        am a programmer!"); } }
    - speaker: Roran
      text: I see the pattern now. Class name, main method, print statement, close
        everything.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Excellent! You're grasping the structure. That's the hardest part for
        beginners.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Now, practice at the Hello World Altar. Fill in the missing parts to
        create your first program.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Remember: class name with capital letter, exact main signature, println
        with quotes and semicolon, and close all braces.'
  - conversationId: Arin_02b_PostHello
    lines:
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Excellent work! Your first program prints a message.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: So many symbols for just one sentence.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Symbols give structure; structure gives power. Every character matters
        in programming.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'You''ve learned the foundation: classes, methods, statements, braces,
        and semicolons.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Next, we'll learn how to store values using variables and data types.
  - conversationId: Arin_03_TypesLecture
    lines:
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Welcome back to my cabin. Today we learn about DATA TYPES and VARIABLES\u2014the
        building blocks of programming."
    - speaker: Roran
      text: What are variables?
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Variables are containers that store information. Think of them as labeled
        boxes that hold different kinds of data.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Each variable has a TYPE and a NAME. The TYPE defines what kind of data
        it can hold. The NAME is how you identify it.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: Why do we need different types?
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Because different data serves different purposes. You wouldn't store
        a player's name the same way you store their health points.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Java has several primitive data types. Let me explain the four most
        important ones in detail:'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "First: INT. This stores whole numbers\u2014positive, negative, or zero."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Examples of int values: 5, -10, 0, 1000, 42, -999'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Use int for things like: player health, score, age, quantity, level,
        lives remaining.'
    - speaker: Roran
      text: So int is for counting things?
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Exactly! Anything you can count without fractions: 10 apples, 3 lives,
        500 gold coins.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "But remember: int cannot store decimals. 3.5 is NOT a valid int\u2014it
        would need to be 3 or 4."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Second: DOUBLE. This stores decimal numbers\u2014numbers with fractional
        parts."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Examples of double values: 3.14, -0.5, 2.0, 99.99, 1.5, 0.001'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Use double for: speed, temperature, money amounts, precise calculations,
        percentages.'
    - speaker: Roran
      text: So when I need the exact value with decimals?
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Precisely! If a potion restores 2.5 health per second, you need double,
        not int.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: If your character moves at 3.75 units per second, you need double.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Third: BOOLEAN. This stores true or false values\u2014only two possibilities."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: A boolean is like a yes/no question. It can only be true OR false, never
        anything else.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Examples: true, false (those are the ONLY two values a boolean can have)'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Use boolean for: isAlive, hasKey, gameOver, canJump, isGrounded, isDead\u2014any
        yes/no condition."
    - speaker: Roran
      text: So it's for checking if something is true or not?
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Exactly! Is the player alive? true or false. Does the player have the
        key? true or false.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Boolean values are crucial for making decisions in code, which you'll
        learn later.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Fourth: STRING. This stores text\u2014sequences of characters."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Examples: "Hello", "Roran", "Oak Woods", "Welcome, traveler!", "Game
        Over"'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Strings always use DOUBLE QUOTES. Without quotes, Java thinks it's a
        variable name, not text.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Notice: String is capitalized because it''s technically a class, not
        a primitive type. But it works similarly.'
    - speaker: Roran
      text: So int for whole numbers, double for decimals, boolean for true/false,
        and String for text.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Perfect summary! Now let's see how to DECLARE variables\u2014that means
        creating them."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'The syntax is: TYPE variableName = value;'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Let me show you examples for each type:'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "int lives = 3;  \u2014 Creates a variable named 'lives' of type int,
        and assigns it the value 3."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "int score = 1000;  \u2014 Creates 'score' as an int with value 1000."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "int health = 100;  \u2014 Creates 'health' as an int with value 100."
    - speaker: Roran
      text: So I write the type first, then the name, then equals, then the value?
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Exactly! And always end with a semicolon. Let''s see double examples:'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "double speed = 2.5;  \u2014 Creates a variable named 'speed' with value
        2.5."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "double temperature = 98.6;  \u2014 Creates 'temperature' with value
        98.6."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "double price = 19.99;  \u2014 Creates 'price' with value 19.99."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Now boolean examples:'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "boolean isMage = false;  \u2014 Creates 'isMage' and sets it to false."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "boolean isAlive = true;  \u2014 Creates 'isAlive' and sets it to true."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "boolean hasKey = false;  \u2014 Creates 'hasKey' and sets it to false."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Finally, String examples:'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "String name = \"Roran\";  \u2014 Creates 'name' and assigns it the text
        \"Roran\"."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "String greeting = \"Hello, traveler!\";  \u2014 Creates 'greeting' with
        a message."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "String title = \"Codebreaker\";  \u2014 Creates 'title' with value \"Codebreaker\"."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Notice: Strings need DOUBLE QUOTES around the text. Numbers and boolean
        values do NOT use quotes.'
    - speaker: Roran
      text: What about the semicolon?
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Always required! Every declaration is a statement, and every statement
        ends with a semicolon.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Forget the semicolon, and your program won't compile. It's one of the
        most common beginner mistakes.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Now, about variable NAMES: they are case-sensitive. ''name'' and ''Name''
        are different variables.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Use descriptive names: playerHealth is better than x. maxSpeed is better
        than y.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Names should start with a lowercase letter and use camelCase for multiple
        words.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Good examples: playerScore, isGameOver, maxAttempts, userName, currentLevel.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Bad examples: x, y, var1, temp, a, b (not descriptive enough).'
    - speaker: Roran
      text: I can also assign values later, right?
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Yes! You can declare first, then assign: int count;  count = 10;'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'But it''s cleaner to do both at once when possible: int count = 10;'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Remember: You MUST declare a variable with its type before using it.
        Java needs to know what type it is.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Let me give you a complete program example using all four types:'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: class PlayerStats { public static void main(String[] args) { int health
        = 100; double speed = 2.5; boolean isAlive = true; String name = "Roran";
        } }
    - speaker: Roran
      text: I see! Different types for different kinds of information.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Perfect! One more important thing: you can change a variable''s value
        after creating it.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "For example: int lives = 3;  lives = 2;  lives = 1;  \u2014 The value
        changes, but the type stays int."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "But you CANNOT change the type: int lives = 3;  lives = \"text\";  \u2014
        This is an error!"
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Once a variable is declared as int, it can only hold int values. Same
        for all types.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Now, I have a challenge for you. The sacred grove's wards are weakening.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'To restore them, you must collect four Type Runes: int, double, boolean,
        and String.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: But these runes are guarded by ancient knowledge. To collect each rune,
        you must answer a question about that type.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: This will test your understanding. Go forth and prove you've mastered
        the types!
  - conversationId: Arin_03_PostTypes
    lines:
    - speaker: Arin
      text: The wards are stable again. You've mastered the fundamental types!
    - speaker: Roran
      text: The questions really made me think about each type carefully.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: That's the point! Understanding when to use each type is as important
        as knowing they exist.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: One missing semicolon, one wrong type, and everything breaks.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "That's the nature of syntax\u2014every symbol matters. Even one mistake
        can prevent your program from running."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: But don't be discouraged. Every programmer makes syntax errors. You'll
        get better with practice.
    - speaker: Arin

    - speaker: Arin
      text: Welcome back. Today we master the art of STRINGS and PRINTING.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: I know strings are text, but what else should I learn?
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Strings are more powerful than you think. Let's start with STRING LITERALS.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'A string literal is text wrapped in double quotes: "Hello, World!"'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'You can assign it to a variable: String message = "Welcome, traveler.";'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Now, what if you want to include special characters in your strings?
    - speaker: Arin
      text: That's where ESCAPE SEQUENCES come in. They start with a backslash \
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "\\n creates a NEW LINE\u2014moves to the next line."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Example: System.out.println("First line\nSecond line");'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'This prints: First line (then goes to new line) Second line.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "\\t creates a TAB\u2014adds horizontal spacing."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Example: System.out.println("Name:\tRoran");'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'This adds tab space between Name: and Roran.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: \" allows you to include DOUBLE QUOTES inside a string.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Example: System.out.println("She said, \"Hello!\" ");'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'This prints: She said, "Hello!"'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: \\ allows you to print an actual BACKSLASH.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Example: System.out.println("Path: C:\\Users\\Roran");'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'This prints: Path: C:\Users\Roran'
    - speaker: Roran
      text: So backslash is the escape character that gives special meaning to the
        next character.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Precisely! Now let's talk about STRING CONCATENATION.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Concatenation means joining strings together using the PLUS SIGN +
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Example: String firstName = "Roran"; String fullName = firstName + "
        the Brave";'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Result: fullName becomes "Roran the Brave"'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'You can concatenate multiple strings: "Hello, " + "my " + "friend!"'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'You can also mix strings with variables:'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'int level = 5; System.out.println("Level: " + level);'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'This prints: Level: 5'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: The number is automatically converted to a string and joined.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: What about print versus println?
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Excellent question! System.out.println adds a new line after printing.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "System.out.print does NOT add a new line\u2014the next output continues
        on the same line."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Example: System.out.print("Hello "); System.out.print("World");'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Prints: Hello World (on one line)'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'But: System.out.println("Hello "); System.out.println("World");'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Prints: Hello (new line) World'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Use print when you want to build output on the same line. Use println
        when you want each output on its own line.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: This is powerful! I can create formatted output now.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Exactly! Strings and escape sequences let you control exactly how your
        text appears.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Now, let's practice these concepts with some exercises.

    - speaker: Arin
      text: Perfect! You've mastered string manipulation.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: I can shape messages exactly how I want them now.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: String manipulation is essential. Nearly every program displays text
        to users.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: You've learned literals, escape sequences, and concatenation. Well done!
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'One final trial remains: the Syntax Trial, where you''ll combine everything
        you''ve learned.'

    lines:
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Welcome back, Roran. This is your final test in Oak Woods.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: I'm ready.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Let''s review everything you''ve learned. First: THE CLASS.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: A class is the container for your code. Every Java program needs at least
        one class.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Syntax: class ClassName { ... }'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Class names start with a capital letter. Use descriptive names.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Next: THE MAIN METHOD.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "This is the entry point\u2014where program execution begins."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Signature: public static void main(String[] args) { ... }'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Memorize this exact format. Every standalone Java program needs it.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Next: STATEMENTS.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Statements are instructions for the computer. They go inside the main
        method.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Every statement ends with a SEMICOLON ;
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Examples: variable declarations, method calls, assignments.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Next: BRACES AND STRUCTURE.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Curly braces { } define code blocks. Every opening brace needs a matching
        closing brace.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Proper indentation makes code readable, though Java doesn't require it.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Indent code inside braces for clarity.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Next: DATA TYPES.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: int for whole numbers. double for decimals. boolean for true/false. String
        for text.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Declare variables with: type name = value;'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Choose meaningful names. Use camelCase for multi-word names.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Next: STRINGS AND PRINTING.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Use System.out.println() to print with a new line. Use System.out.print()
        to stay on same line.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Escape sequences: \n for new line, \t for tab, \" for quotes, \\ for
        backslash.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Concatenate strings with the + operator: "Hello " + "World"'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'You can concatenate strings with numbers: "Score: " + 100'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Finally: COMMENTS.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Comments are notes for humans\u2014Java ignores them when running the
        program."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Single-line comment: // This is a comment'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Multi-line comment: /* This can span multiple lines */'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Use comments to explain complex code or leave notes for yourself.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: I remember all of it. Class, main, types, strings, syntax rules.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Excellent. Now prove it. Complete the Syntax Trial.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: 'Write a complete Java program with: a class, the main method, variable
        declarations, string concatenation, and println statements.'
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Every brace must match. Every statement must end with a semicolon. All
        syntax must be perfect.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: This is your test, Codebreaker. Show me what you've learned.

    - speaker: Arin
      text: "Beyond Oak Woods, you'll learn control flow\u2014making decisions with
        if statements, repeating actions with loops."
    - speaker: Arin
      text: You'll master methods, arrays, objects, and more. But you've proven you
        can handle it.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Oak Woods recognizes you now, Roran. You are officially a Codebreaker.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: Thank you, Arin. I couldn't have done this without your guidance.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: Syntax is your compass. Keep practicing, keep coding, and never stop
        learning.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: The world of programming is vast. You've taken your first steps. Walk
        forward with confidence.
    - speaker: Roran
      text: I will. Thank you, mentor.
    - speaker: Arin
      text: If fate brings you back to Oak Woods, I'll be here. For now, go forth
        and code, Codebreaker.
