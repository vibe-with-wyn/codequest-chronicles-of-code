  instructions: Answer all questions correctly to complete this quest objective.
  questions:
  - questionText: What is the entry point of every Java application?
    choices:
    - choiceText: The main() method
      isCorrect: 1
    - choiceText: The start() method
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: The run() method
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: The init() method
      isCorrect: 0
    hintOnWrongAnswer: Every Java program starts execution from a specific method.
      It's the first method called when the program runs, and it has a very specific
      signature that includes 'String[] args'.
    explanationOnCorrect: Correct! The main() method is the entry point of every
      Java application. The JVM looks for this method to begin program execution.
  - questionText: Which statement is used to display text in the console in Java?
    choices:
    - choiceText: System.out.println()
      isCorrect: 1
    - choiceText: console.log()
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: print()
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: display()
      isCorrect: 0
    hintOnWrongAnswer: Think about what Arin showed you in the lecture. It's a method
      that 'prints' to the system output, and it comes from the System class.
    explanationOnCorrect: Perfect! System.out.println() is used to print text to
      the console. 'println' stands for 'print line', which prints the text and moves
      to a new line.
  - questionText: What is the exact signature of the main method that every Java
      program needs?
    choices:
    - choiceText: public void main(String[] args)
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: public static void main(String[] args)
      isCorrect: 1
    - choiceText: static void main(String args)
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: public static main(String[] args)
      isCorrect: 0
    hintOnWrongAnswer: Arin taught you to memorize this exact format. It starts with
      'public static void main' and includes String[] args in parentheses. The order
      and spelling of every word matters!
    explanationOnCorrect: Excellent! 'public static void main(String[] args)' is
      the exact signature. PUBLIC means accessible from anywhere, STATIC means it
      belongs to the class, VOID means no return value, and String[] args allows
      passing text arguments when running the program.
  - questionText: In Java, what is the purpose of curly braces { }?
    choices:
    - choiceText: To store variable values
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: To create comments in the code
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: To group blocks of code together
      isCorrect: 1
    - choiceText: To end statements like semicolons
      isCorrect: 0
    hintOnWrongAnswer: 'Remember what Arin said: curly braces group blocks of code
      together. Your class starts with { and ends with }. Your main method also starts
      with { and ends with }. They define where code blocks begin and end.'
    explanationOnCorrect: Perfect! Curly braces { } group blocks of code together.
      Every opening brace { MUST have a matching closing brace }. They define the
      boundaries of classes, methods, loops, and other code structures.
  - questionText: Every statement in Java must end with which symbol?
    choices:
    - choiceText: A period ( . )
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: A comma ( , )
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: A closing brace ( } )
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: A semicolon ( ; )
      isCorrect: 1
    hintOnWrongAnswer: Arin compared this to a period ending a sentence. It's a single
      punctuation mark that appears at the end of every Java statement. Think about
      what you saw after System.out.println("Hello!");
    explanationOnCorrect: Correct! Every statement in Java must end with a semicolon
      ( ; ). Think of it as a period ending a sentence. Forgetting the semicolon
      is one of the most common syntax errors for beginners!
