  questions:
  - questionText: What is Java?
    choices:
    - choiceText: A type of coffee
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: A high-level, object-oriented programming language
      isCorrect: 1
    - choiceText: A database management system
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: A web browser

    - choiceText: Colon (:)
      isCorrect: 0
    hintOnWrongAnswer: Remember that Java statements must end with a specific punctuation
      mark. Look at the end of your code lines!
    explanationOnCorrect: Correct! The semicolon (;) is used to terminate statements
      in Java.
  - questionText: What is the purpose of the main method in Java?
    choices:
    - choiceText: To declare variables
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: To serve as the entry point of a Java program
      isCorrect: 1
    - choiceText: To import libraries
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: To create objects
      isCorrect: 0
    hintOnWrongAnswer: Think about where your Java program starts running. What method
      does the JVM look for first?
    explanationOnCorrect: Correct! The main method is the entry point where the JVM
      starts executing your program.
  - questionText: Which data type is used to store whole numbers in Java?
    choices:
    - choiceText: float
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: double
      isCorrect: 1
    - choiceText: String
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: int
      isCorrect: 1
    hintOnWrongAnswer: You need a data type for whole numbers, not decimals. Float
      and double are for decimals!
    explanationOnCorrect: Correct! The 'int' data type stores whole numbers (integers)
      without decimals.
  - questionText: What is the correct way to declare a boolean variable in Java?
    choices:
    - choiceText: boolean isActive = true;
      isCorrect: 1
    - choiceText: bool isActive = true;
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: Boolean isActive = 1;
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: boolean isActive = "true";
      isCorrect: 0
    hintOnWrongAnswer: In Java, boolean is lowercase, not 'bool' or 'Boolean'. The
      value must be true or false (not a string or number)!
    explanationOnCorrect: Correct! Boolean variables in Java are declared with 'boolean'
      (lowercase) and can be true or false.
  - questionText: Which data type would you use to store the value 3.14159?
    choices:
    - choiceText: int
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: char
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: double
      isCorrect: 1
    - choiceText: boolean
      isCorrect: 0
    hintOnWrongAnswer: This is a decimal number (floating-point). You need a data
      type that can store fractional values!
    explanationOnCorrect: Correct! The 'double' data type is used for decimal numbers
      with high precision.
  - questionText: What is the size of a char data type in Java?
    choices:
    - choiceText: 8 bits
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: 16 bits
      isCorrect: 1
    - choiceText: 32 bits
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: 64 bits
      isCorrect: 0
    hintOnWrongAnswer: Java uses Unicode for characters. Think about how many bits
      are needed to store thousands of characters!
    explanationOnCorrect: Correct! In Java, a char is 16 bits (2 bytes) and uses
      Unicode encoding.
  - questionText: Which method is used to print output to the console in Java?
    choices:
    - choiceText: System.out.println()
      isCorrect: 1
    - choiceText: System.out.write()
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: console.log()
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: print()
      isCorrect: 0
    hintOnWrongAnswer: Remember the Strings & Printing lesson! You used this method
      to print 'Hello World' to the console.
    explanationOnCorrect: Correct! System.out.println() prints text to the console
      and moves to a new line.
  - questionText: How do you concatenate two strings in Java?
    choices:
    - choiceText: Using the + operator
      isCorrect: 1
    - choiceText: Using the * operator
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: Using the & operator
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: Using the concat() method only
      isCorrect: 0
    hintOnWrongAnswer: You can join strings using a simple arithmetic-like operator.
      What operator 'adds' things together?
    explanationOnCorrect: Correct! The + operator is the most common way to join
      (concatenate) strings in Java.
  - questionText: What will be the output of the following code? String greeting
      = "Hello"; String name = "World"; System.out.println(greeting + " " + name
      + "!");
    choices:
    - choiceText: Hello World
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: HelloWorld!
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: greeting name!
      isCorrect: 0
    - choiceText: Hello World!
      isCorrect: 1
    hintOnWrongAnswer: The + operator joins strings together. Count the spaces and
      characters carefully!
    explanationOnCorrect: Correct! String concatenation joins 'Hello', a space, 'World',
      and '!' to produce 'Hello World!'
